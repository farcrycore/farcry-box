./code
============

Your code goes here.  Everything in this folder is synced into the vagrant virtual machine.

You will need at least repos for:

```
./core <-- a version of farcry core framework
./projects/chelsea <-- your project code
```

The sample workbench manages these code bases with repos installed as git submodules.
